# ChargeFinder

An iOS App made in my internship at Novasa Interactive ApS, the App is available on App Store free of charge.

ChargeFinder is an app that can locate charge points in and around europe with main focus on scandinavia.

It shows charge points from Tesla Supercharger, E-On and Clever. It has filters that can be used filter specific charger types.
The app is far from perfect, but do what it is supposed to. Code could be a lot cleaner, in retrospect a lot of the design
choices, in terms of how the app is build could have been done differently and better.

Frameworks and languages used to build the app is:

- Swift Programming language
- Apple MapKit
- Apple CoreLocation
- Google Firebase
- External api calls for getting Charger information.

The project was a great learning experience for me and was my first attempt at building the ui programmatically and following a
design designed by a designer.
